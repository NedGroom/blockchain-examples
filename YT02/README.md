This folder is my workspace for going through the following youtube video:

"Creating a blockchain with Javascript" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124

Author: "Simply Explained", (Xavier)

Purpose:

    Refamiliarise myself with JavaScript.
    Go through different basic implementation so as not to be tied down.

Conlclusion notes:

   Does not contain
        proof of work
        peer-to-peer network connection to other miners
        how to restore to valid chain

Informal notes while doing:

    If writing down a function name, then you are passing the function.
    If you want to call the function - ADD () AT THE END AND DO NOT FORGET.
    After this still forgot - make sure to check this scenareo: newBlock.previousHash = this.getLatestBlock.hash
