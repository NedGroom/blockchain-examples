I have not spent much time on this.. It was during some time off that I wanted to further my understanding of different blockchain technologies by looking at different approaches to low-level implementation.

# blockchain-examples
This will contain different projects which will each showcase different aspects of blockchain technologies. References will be included here to research and videos used.

Concepts that I have cemented understanding for through implementation:

    Proof of work via nonce usage, making block mining difficult.
