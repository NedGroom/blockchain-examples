This folder is my workspace for going through the following youtube video:

"Truffle Tutorial for Beginners | Compile, Test & Deploy Smart contracts to any EVM Blockchain" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62f757RVEvU

Author: "EatTheBlocks"

Key steps:

    Run `truffle init` which creates some folders.
    In contracts we put the contracts.
    In migrations, we write files how to deploy smart contrats to the blockchain. (in node.js)
    In test you write the test files, some in Node.js, some in Solidity.

Informal notes while doing:

    Way easier to make blockchain app on truffle.

    Use on all EVM compatible blockchain:
        Ethereum, BSC, Polygon
    Originally just ethereum.

    For deployment, it runs on local development blockchain called `Ganache`.
    For testing the smart contract, it uses javascript framework called `Mocha`.

    Without truffle, need to create a lot of boilerplate code to integrate different tools together.

    Truffle is a command-line framework. 

    Truffle written in Node.js

    npm is Node Package Manager
