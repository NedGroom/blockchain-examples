This folder is my workspace for going through the following youtube video playlist:

Author: "Moralis Web3", (Xavier)

Purpose:

    This is so that I can learn how to use the Moralis development platform to quickly make decentralised apps.

    I will also remind myself on how React.js works for frontend applications.

    Moralis is middleware software that apps can be built upon, allowing easier interaction with blockchains.

    We will be making a simple twitter application.

    1. Authentication
    2. Save user data
    3. File handling
    4. Post data/tweets
    5. Query data/tweets
    6. Cloud functions
    7. Automatic refetch data
    8. Live data (subscriptions)

    Not going over smart contracts.
