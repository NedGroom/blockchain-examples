This folder is my workspace for going through the following youtube video:

"Mining rewards & transactions - Blockchain in Javascript Part 3" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRV6cGXVQ4I

Author: "Simply Explained", (Xavier)

Purpose:

    Expand blockchain implementation secured with proof of work algorithms, to allow each block to contain many transactions, and to add rewards for miners.

    Need virtual money or coins in the system, easiest way is to mine the coins inside of the system.



----


Informal notes while doing:

    Bitcoin POW algorithm makes sure only one block created every 10 mins.

    Not very impressed by this video, though just demonstrating simple concepts.

    Instead of the mine block function, we have the mine pending transactions function.

    We have also added rewards for mining a block.

    At the end, we demonstrate that the rewards are added as a pending transaction so they will not be shown immediately.
